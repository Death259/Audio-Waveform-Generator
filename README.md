## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **High Resolution**: Use larger dimensions (1800x400 or higher) for professional results
- **Aspect Ratio**: Wide aspect ratios (3:1 or 4:1) work best for most waveforms
- **Contrast**: Ensure good contrast between waveform and background colors
- **Smoothing**: Lower values (10-30) for detailed waveforms, higher (100-200) for smooth, minimalist designs
- **Trimming**: Use audio trimming to focus on the most interesting parts of your track
- **Channels**: Use "Separate" for stereo visualization, "Merged" for mono appearance
- **Effects**: Subtle shadows (5-10px blur) add depth without overwhelming
- **Presets**: Save your favorite settings to speed up future projects
- **Dark Mode**: Use dark mode when working in low-light environments
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn the shortcuts for faster workflow
- **SVG Export**: Use SVG format when you need to scale images for different sizes
